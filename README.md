Conditions:

Table 1 shows data from the analytical instrument.
- Each sample (Sample) was measured several times (Replicate);
- For each measurement, the following data were obtained: the total number of cells in the sample (Total), the number of cells in subpopulation A (SubA), and the number of cells in subpopulation B (SubB).
- Subpopulations A (SubA) and B (SubB) do not intersect.

Task:
Write a script in Python that:
- accepts as input a table in any format of the candidateâ€™s choice;
- calculates the average value and coefficient of variation of the percentage of population A;
- calculates the average value and coefficient of variation of the percentage of population B;
- calculates the average value and coefficient of variation of the percentage of a population of cells that are not included in either population A or population B (this population can be called SubC);
- saves calculations in one table.
